# Let CI fetch the household's private crates over ssh.
#
#   scripts/ci-private-crates.sh household-mount [household] [household-kit]
#
# Each argument names a private repository (ThomasAndJuliet/NAME) the job
# needs; its read-only deploy key must be in the environment:
#
#   household-mount  HOUSEHOLD_MOUNT_DEPLOY_KEY
#   household        HOUSEHOLD_DEPLOY_KEY
#   household-kit    HOUSEHOLD_KIT_DEPLOY_KEY
#   libcosmic        LIBCOSMIC_DEPLOY_KEY
#   cosmic-files     COSMIC_FILES_DEPLOY_KEY
#
# For each repository the script
#   - writes the key to a private file (mode 600),
#   - adds an ssh host alias that uses only that key, with GitHub's ed25519
#     host key pinned (checked against https://api.github.com/meta),
#   - maps exactly that repository's ssh URL, as written in Cargo.toml and
#     packaging/flatpak/cargo-sources.json, to the alias with a global git
#     `url.<alias>.insteadOf` rule, and
#   - points git at that ssh configuration (core.sshCommand), so the system
#     ssh config and agent are left alone.
# It also sets CARGO_NET_GIT_FETCH_WITH_CLI=true in $GITHUB_ENV, so that cargo
# fetches with git, and so with these rules; flatpak-builder clones with git.
#
# Files go under $RUNNER_TEMP (else $HOME/.ssh), which works the same on the
# neo runners and in the hosted job's Flatpak container (root, HOME=/github/home).
# Key material is never printed. A missing key fails with a message: forks
# and other untrusted actors have no secrets, so their jobs stop here, clearly,
# rather than in an authentication error from git.
#
# Run it before the first step that fetches crates, passing only the secrets
# that job needs.
